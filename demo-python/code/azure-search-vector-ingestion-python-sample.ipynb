    "# Azure Cognitive Search - Code Sample for chunking documents and generating vector embeddings via indexer composition\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates a pattern of composing multiple indexers to ingest content from blob storage documents, chunk them, generate embeddings and store them as their own documents in a search index. The code sample here will demonstrate storing the chunked document fragments in their own index, but users can choose to co-locate them in the same index if needed. The following image describes this composition pattern\n",
